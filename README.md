## What is CesaConn?

CesaConn is a **secure, serverless, cross-platform device synchronization application** built by CesaSec.

Sync your files, clipboard, notifications, and more — across all your devices — without any central server ever seeing your data. Your data stays yours. Always.

---

## Why CesaConn?

Most sync solutions force you to trust a third party with your data. CesaConn is different:

- **No central server** — data travels directly between your devices
- **End-to-end encrypted** — nobody can read your data, not even us
- **Two independent keys** — one for authentication, one for data
- **You are in full control** — every feature can be turned on or off
- **Zero data collection** — we don't know who you are, and we don't want to
- **Every feature is off by default after updates** — you decide what to enable

---

## Security Architecture

CesaConn is built with a military-grade security stack:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Key Exchange | X25519 ECDH | Secure shared secret — never transmitted |
| Auth Encryption | AES-256-GCM | Encrypt authentication hash |
| Data Encryption | AES-256-GCM | Encrypt transmitted data |
| Key Derivation | Argon2 | Password → cryptographic key |
| Salt Generation | OS Entropy (SysRng) | Cryptographically secure randomness |
| Packet Signing | Ed25519 | Every packet signed — signatures removed after verification |
| Memory Safety | Zeroize | Keys and secrets wiped from RAM after use |

---

### Two Independent Keys

CesaConn uses **two completely separate passwords and keys**:

```
Password 1 (auth)   → Argon2 → Auth Key    → used ONLY for authentication
Password 2 (data)   → Argon2 → Data Key    → used ONLY for data transfer
```

If one key is compromised — the other remains secure. Both must be broken simultaneously for an attacker to succeed.

  PHASE 1 — ECDH KEY EXCHANGE

Device A                              Device B
   │                                     │

   │  Both independently derive          │
   │  the same shared_secret             │
   │  shared_secret is NEVER transmitted │


════════════════════════════════════════
  PHASE 2 — MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION
════════════════════════════════════════

Device A                              Device B
   │                                     │

   │  signature = Ed25519(encrypted)     │

   │                                     │
   │  match  → ✅ authenticated          │
   │  no match → ❌ connection rejected  │

  PHASE 3 — ENCRYPTED DATA TRANSFER
════════════════════════════════════════

Device A                              Device B
   │                                     │

   │  signature = Ed25519(encrypted)     │

### Why this matters

| Attack | CesaConn |
|---|---|
| Man-in-the-middle | ❌ Blocked by mutual authentication |
| Packet tampering | ❌ Blocked by Ed25519 signatures |
| Replay attack | ❌ Blocked by unique nonces |
| Eavesdropping | ❌ Blocked by AES-256-GCM |
| Auth key compromise | ❌ Data key still secure |
| Data key compromise | ❌ Auth key still secure |
| Brute force password | ❌ Blocked by Argon2 KDF |
| Key theft from RAM | ❌ Keys wiped by Zeroize |
| Server breach | ❌ There is no server |

## Philosophy

> Every feature is **off by default** after updates. You decide what to enable. We don't decide for you.

CesaConn is built on the belief that software should serve the user — not the developer. No forced features. No hidden telemetry. No dark patterns.
